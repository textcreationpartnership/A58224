            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>REASONS Againſt making the RIVER <hi>DARWENT,</hi> in the County of <hi>Derby,</hi> NAVIGABLE.</head>
            <p n="1">I. THE Mayor and Burgeſſes of <hi>Derby,</hi> have Thrice heretofore attempted, without Succeſs, the making this River Navigable.</p>
            <p n="2">II. There is no Common Bridge over the ſaid River, but many Fords, through which Carts and Carriages daily, and Mill-ſtones frequently do paſs. Now by conſtant deepening the Channel to keep the River Navigable, no New Fords can ever be caſt up; and if the Old ones wear out, which often happens, all Communication of the Inhabitants on the one ſide of the River, with thoſe on the other, will be loſt; for the Undertakers are not willing to make Bridges.</p>
            <p n="3">III. On this River are divers Corn-Mills and Fulling-Mills, which this Navigation will often lay dry, and frequently interrupt their Working, to the great damage of the Country thereabouts, and endanger the breaking of the Wares, to the da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Owners.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. This intended Navigation will not, as is pretended, Advance the Trade of any Market, or other Town lying near the ſaid River, or the River <hi>Trent;</hi> but inſtead thereof, it will much abate the Trade of <hi>Nottingham, Mansfield, Blyth, Tuxford, Worſop, Bautry,</hi> &amp;c. which is driven thence through <hi>Scarſdale</hi> by Land-Carriage into <hi>York-ſhire, Lancaſhire,</hi> and <hi>Cheſhire,</hi> and by this means mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes of Families will be utterly undone, who now get their Living by Land-Carriage.</p>
            <p n="5">V. Nor can this intended Navigation be any ways commodious for the quicker and cheaper conveying of Goods to the Port of <hi>London</hi> (which is the principal Reaſon that all Navigators urge for ſuch their Undertaking) for oftentimes the Stream of this River for a Month or ſix Weeks together, is ſo ſmall and ſhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that it will ſcarce carry a little Fiſhing-Boat; all which time the greater Veſſels with their Lading, muſt lie ſtill, and the Trader often loſe the advantage of that Market, which he might have been ſure of by Land-Carriage.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. And as for the Preſervation of the High-ways, a Benefit which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended will be wrought by this Navigation, this Navigation can only ſave five Miles of Land-Carriage, <hi>viz.</hi> from <hi>Derby</hi> to <hi>Wiln-Ferry,</hi> and all who are liable to the repair of thoſe High-ways, had much rather bear that Charge, than be barr'd the conveniency of paſſing the River <hi>Darwent</hi> when they have occaſion.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. If this River were capable of being made Navigable, (as in the opinion of all who know it well, it is not) yet it would be advantageous to none, beſides a few Tradeſmen in <hi>Derby,</hi> but very prejudicial to many who live there, and get a comfortable Livelihood by Land-Carriage from thence to <hi>Wiln-Ferry,</hi> yet dare not, for fear of the Great ones of the Town, ſhew their diſlike of the Navigation.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Now by this Navigation, to enrich ſome of the Town of <hi>Derby</hi> and impoveriſh others, to ſubvert the Trade of all the Market-Towns in <hi>Nottingham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> and greatly to annoy all the Gentlemens Eſtates on the Banks of the River <hi>Darwent,</hi> is juſt as reaſonable, as to rob all the Apoſtles to enrich St. <hi>Peter.</hi>
